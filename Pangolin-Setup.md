At Geeks we work using visual studio as the core IDE for development, as such all our Test solutions are also created in Visual studio.

Creating a new pangolin project is a simple process that requires the following steps.

 1. In Visual studio create a new **Unit Test Project**
 2. Open the Nuget package manager in Visual Studio. 
 3. Search for and install the Pangolin package (This will also install all the dependencies required for pangolin to function).
